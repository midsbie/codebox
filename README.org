* codebox

Run Claude Code in a sandboxed Docker container with host UID/GID mapping.

** Requirements

- Docker with Compose
- Claude Code installed on host (~/.local/bin/claude)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set

** Setup

Build image for your user (once):

#+begin_src sh
./cbox build
#+end_src

** Usage

Run from any git repository:

#+begin_src sh
./cbox
#+end_src

** Commands

| Command | Description                    |
|---------+--------------------------------|
| run     | Run claude (default)           |
| build   | Build image for current user   |
| kill    | Kill running codebox containers|
| help    | Show usage                     |

** How it works

The image is built with your UID/GID baked in. Mounted volumes (repo, config) have correct ownership. Each user needs their own image.
